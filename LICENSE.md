==========================

Version: 1.0
Effective Date: 2025-11-29

Copyright (c) 2025 Taher Motukuna and contributors

Overview
--------
This Freemium License governs the use, modification, and distribution of "Chat UI" (the Software).

Under this license:
- The "Core" features included in the repository are available for free for personal and commercial use.
- Certain advanced features, integrations, add-ons, or pre-built premium content may be designated as "Premium Features" and are not licensed for free redistribution or commercial redistribution without a separate paid license.

Grant of Rights
---------------
- You are free to use, copy, modify and distribute the Software (the Core features) for personal or commercial purposes under the terms of this license.
- You may include the Core software in commercial solutions as long as the attribution and license reference described below are preserved.
- Any Premium Features included in the repository are explicitly limited; using or reselling Premium Features in a commercial product requires a separate license.

Distribution & Attribution
--------------------------
- When redistributing the Core software (in source or binary form), you must include this Freemium License file and keep author attribution intact.
- You may not remove or modify author credits or this license text.

Premium Feature Restrictions
----------------------------
- Premium Features are any features, files, or content marked in the code, docs, or listing as "Premium" and require a paid license to use them in commercial offerings.
- Removing license tags in the source does not grant rights—the original author retains all rights to Premium code until an explicit commercial license is granted.

Modifications & Derived Works
----------------------------
- Modifications and derived works are permitted under this Freemium License, but the license restrictions on Premium Features remain.
- If you modify the core source code and distribute it, you must include this Freemium License and indicate your changes.

No Warranty
----------
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY.

Commercial Licenses & Support
----------------------------
For commercial redistribution that includes Premium Features, or for professional support, white-label options, or additional services, contact the author (see support info in README).

Termination
-----------
This license will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with the terms. On termination, you must cease distribution and remove the Software from public or commercial offerings that violate the license.
